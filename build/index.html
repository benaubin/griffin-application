              It didn't feel right to turn in a sheet of paper to a school that may define the rest of my life. I wanted to
              create something that not only answers the questions you ask of applicants but also allows me the creative
              freedom to share my nature and interests in a more meaningful way.

              I solving problems that I come across. At the start of 6th grade, I was trying to find a homework
              planner that worked for me, but as hard as I looked, I couldn't find one. I decided to create my own. I taught
              myself how to code, and over the course of a year, I created <a href="http://planhw.com" target="_blank">PlanHW</a>.
              It worked great. I shared it with friends, many of which loved using it, and it solved the problem I saw.

              Telling stories is amazing. I started a <a href="https://heyaustin.org" target="_blank">student publication</a>
              with some friends to explore topics that matter to our city, like the
              <a href="https://heyaustin.org/grove/" target="_blank">piece</a> I wrote about the Grove at Shoal Creek.
              I love telling stories with whatever tools I can use, whether it's video, graphics, or even just fonts, I love
              using them to create captivating experiences.

              I work with groups that get amazing things done. I led a group of middle-schoolers as we planned our school's
              annual Global Festival, a winter celebration of all cultures. I am part of our school's No Place for Hate
              committee, a group of students who promote respect and diversity with activities throughout the year. Last
              Thursday, I rallied together a group of students to take over a school fundraiser after chaos left the
              previous group to abandon the project.

              I've been at ACE for the past 3 years. Part of going to a gifted school meant I could take courses years above
              my grade, all of which have been challenging. That doesn't mean I don't like them - the most rewarding
              experience in school is when I turn in that paper I worked so hard on, or when I learn something new and am
              able to do things that were impossible for me before.

              I think the purpose of school is to be prepared for a life outside of school. To me, being ready for college
              and learning skills that will help me throughout my life are the most important goals of high school. As a
              student, that means striving towards having good grades, learning career skills taught in electives, but also
              learning about myself and figuring out what I want to do with my life. My role in achieving these goals is to
              work as hard as I can during school and to learn and try everything that interests me outside of it.
            </p>

              When I shadowed Griffin at the start of this year, there were tons of qualities that instantly made me fall in
              love with the school. All of the classes were extremely engaging. I'm interested in programming, and the
              coding class I shadowed was a delight. It was engaging and the activity was fun and challenging. I loved how
              the World Geography class incorporated a hands-on writing exercise. Still, what makes me want to attend the
              most is the culture. When I shadowed, everyone was friendly and supportive to each other. The hallways were
              filled with excitement and music, almost as if it was out of a scene from a movie. Griffin seems like a school
              that is perfect for me - it's engaging and challenging, and there was no class in which I was bored or staring
              off into space, watching the time tick by. That's a good sign.
