        %h2 I made this.
        %p.lead
          It didn't feel right to turn in a sheet of paper to a school that may define the rest of my life. I wanted to
          create something that not only answers the questions you ask of applicants but also allows me the creative
          freedom to share my nature and interests in a more meaningful way.

          I use code to solve problems. At the start of 6th grade, I was trying to find a homework
          planner that worked for me, but as hard as I looked, I couldn't find one. I decided to create my own. I taught
          myself how to code, and over the course of a year, I created <a href="http://planhw.com" target="_blank">PlanHW</a>.
          It worked great. I shared it with friends, many of whom loved using it, and it solved my problem. I still use
          code to make amazing websites, apps and games.

        %p.lead
          Telling stories is amazing. I started a <a href="https://heyaustin.org" target="_blank">student publication</a>
          with some friends to explore topics that matter to our city. For example, I
          <a href="https://heyaustin.org/grove/" target="_blank">wrote an article</a> about a controversial development
          plan off of Shoal Creek, a topic that dominated city politics. I love the creative experience of telling
          stories in many ways with whatever tools I can use, whether it's video, graphics, or interactive experiences.

        %p.lead
          I work with groups that get amazing things done. I led a team of middle-schoolers as we planned our annual
          Global Festival, a winter celebration of all cultures. In addition, I am part of the No Place for Hate
          committee at my school, a group of students who create activities that promote respect and diversity
          throughout the year. Last Thursday, I worked with a group of other students to reignite a school fundraiser
          that was left in chaos after being abandoned by a previous group.

          I've been at ACE for the past 3 years. Part of going there meant I could take challenging courses years above
          my grade level. The most rewarding experiences in school are when I finally turn in that paper I worked so
          hard on or when I am able to do things that once felt almost unimaginable before after learning something new.

          I think the purpose of school is to be prepared for a meaningful adult life. Being ready for college
          and learning things that will help me throughout my life are the most important goals of high school. As a
          student, that means not only striving towards earning good grades, but also learning about myself and
          figuring out what I want to do with my life. My role in achieving these goals is to work as hard as I can and
          to prepare myself for anything that lies ahead.

          I fell in love with Griffin when I shadowed towards the start of the year. All the classes were engaging. Two
          examples were the challenging activities of the coding elective and the hands-on writing exercise in the
          World Geography class. Still, most important was the supportive and friendly environment displayed by students
          and teachers. The hallways were filled with excitement and music, almost as if it was out of a scene from a
          movie. Throughout the visit, there was no moment in which I was bored or staring off into space. I was always
          engaged in the classes, never just watching the time tick by. That's a good sign.

            school work. It requires that you make a commitment to the Essential Values of the school
            and participate fully in school activities and events.
