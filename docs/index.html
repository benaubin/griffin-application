<h2>I made this.</h2>
<p class='lead'>
It didn't feel right to turn in a sheet of paper to a school that may define the rest of my life. I wanted to
create something that not only answers the questions you ask of applicants but also allows me the creative
freedom to share my nature and interests in a more meaningful way.

<h2>I am a developer.</h2>

<div class='col-sm-6'>
<p class='lead'>
I use code to solve problems. At the start of 6th grade, I was trying to find a homework
planner that worked for me, but as hard as I looked, I couldn't find one. I decided to create my own. I taught
myself how to code, and over the course of a year, I created <a href="http://planhw.com" target="_blank">PlanHW</a>.
It worked great. I shared it with friends, many of whom loved using it, and it solved my problem. I still use
code to make amazing websites, apps and games.

<h2>I am a story-teller.</h2>
<p class='lead'>
Telling stories is amazing. I started a <a href="https://heyaustin.org" target="_blank">student publication</a>
with some friends to explore topics that matter to our city. For example, I
<a href="https://heyaustin.org/grove/" target="_blank">wrote an article</a> about a controversial development
plan off of Shoal Creek, a topic that dominated city politics. I love the creative experience of telling
stories in many ways with whatever tools I can use, whether it's video, graphics, or interactive experiences.

<h2>I am a leader.</h2>
<p class='lead'>
I work with groups that get amazing things done. I led a team of middle-schoolers as we planned our annual
Global Festival, a winter celebration of all cultures. In addition, I am part of the No Place for Hate
committee at my school, a group of students who create activities that promote respect and diversity
throughout the year. Last Thursday, I worked with a group of other students to reignite a school fundraiser
that was left in chaos after being abandoned by a previous group.

<h2>I am a student.</h2>
<p class='lead'>
I've been at ACE for the past 3 years. Part of going there meant I could take challenging courses years above
my grade level. The most rewarding experiences in school are when I finally turn in that paper I worked so
hard on or when I am able to do things that once felt almost unimaginable before after learning something new.

One area that Ben excels in is using technology to analyze and present data. He is<mark>consistently
adept</mark> at trying new software to make his projects <mark>unique and detailed</mark>. His corn project
and his dichotomous key were given extra credit because of the level of <mark>detail and novelty</mark>
using technology.
